## Project Log

### 2026-01-12
- Created Fabric Lakehouse with schemas enabled
- Built within existing workspace due to tenant restrictions
- Created Bronze folder structure in Lakehouse Files
- Noted that Fabric Lakehouse schemas are implicit and created on table write


### 2026-01-13
-Created synthetic EMIS-style raw CSV
EMIS Number: fake patient identifier (numeric, unique)
Code: fake record code (e.g., EMIS001…)
National Practice Code: use fake practice codes like P00001, not real NHS codes
Slot Type examples: GP Face to Face, Telephone, Nurse Face to Face, Pharmacy, Online Consultation
Current Slot Status examples: Completed, Cancelled by Patient, Cancelled by Practice, Did Not Attend

- Delta Lake does not allow spaces or special characters in column names
- Applied minimal column standardisation at Bronze ingestion to ensure Delta compatibility
- Preserved original semantics and documented column mappings (tbc in week 2)
- Validated Bronze ingestion: all columns stored as strings and row counts match source CSV

- Dataflow Gen2 could not be used due to tenant licensing and identity restrictions (OneDrive/SharePoint not enabled)
- Implemented reference data ingestion using Spark notebook with Power Query–equivalent shaping
- Loaded output to bronze.practice_reference_raw

- Spark-created Lakehouse tables were not immediately visible via SQL endpoint
- Validated table existence via Spark SHOW TABLES and Lakehouse UI preview
- Noted Spark vs SQL surface differences in Fabric tenant

### 23-01-26
- Created Silver layer for appointments and practice reference
- Enforced data types, value constraints, and null rules
- Standardised gender and validated appointment statuses
- Confirmed Silver tables are join-ready


## 08-02-26

- Created silver schema
- Built Silver appointments transformation (cast age, parse date, standardise gender, enforce null rules)
- Built Silver reference transformation (dedupe, null rules)
- Ran validations (null checks, allowed values, join readiness)
- Confirmed SQL endpoint visibility after propagation delay
- Noted any constraints/issues encountered
